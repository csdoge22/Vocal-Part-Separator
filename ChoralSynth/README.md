# Dataset
### Overview
ChoralSynth is a synthesized dataset of 20 multitrack choral songs curated by carefully listening and analyzing a set of synthetic choral songs generated using one of the state-of-the-art synthesizers. The resulting dataset can serve as a valuable resource for various MIR research endeavors like source separation, melodic analysis, chord analysis, rhythmic analysis amongst others.

### Dataset Curation Process
- **Manual Criteria Design**: The initial step involved the manual design of filtering criteria. This design was based on a careful examination of over 300 scores and their corresponding synthesized versions to ensure comprehensive and relevant criteria. 
- **Automatic Filtering**: Subsequently, the designed criteria were used for automatic filtering of the scores. 
- **Manual Verification**: The filtered songs from step 2 were then examined again manually, 
validating the synthetic versions through attentive listening, ensuring they demonstrated completeness and a resemblance to human singing. 

### Dataset Description

Overall, the dataset contains 20 choral pieces with each of them consisting of the following:

- musicXML score with all voice parts
- MIDI file with all voices
- multitrack recording containing one track per voice
- beat positions
- metadata consisting of  type of voices in the score like soprano, alto, tenor or bass, language and composer


## Downloading the data
The dataset is available for conducting non-commercial research related to choral singing. It is available for download on Zenodo.
